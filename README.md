‚ú® Core Features
Secure Authentication: JWT-based authentication with password hashing (bcrypt). Users can register, log in, and log out securely.

Session Management: A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for users to manage their personal wellness sessions.

Draft & Publish System: Sessions can be saved as private drafts before being published for others to see.

Auto-Save: In the session editor, drafts are automatically saved 5 seconds after the user stops typing, preventing data loss.

Protected Routes: Backend API routes and frontend pages are protected, ensuring only authenticated users can access sensitive data and features.

Responsive UI: A clean, modern, and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS that works on all devices.
